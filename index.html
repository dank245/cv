                <h3>What I did</h3>
                <p>I have been working for 20 years as a freelancer in customer service and translation, as well as an employee in logistics, where I have experience in supply line management, export, shipping and international transport, and as an independent entrepreneur in the service and catering sector.

                    As a freelancer, I am both a customer service agent for inbound and outbound roles as well as a translator revising texts translated by artificial intelligence into native texts.
                    
                    In logistics, I was responsible for managing delivery processes, monitoring production and managing the delivery process through to delivery to the customer. I have experience in customs clearance as well as in organizing international removals, relocation storage, transport from / to the port or airport. The result of this work was proper and punctual deliveries to the customer, reduction of raw materials, costs for packaging materials and a high level of customer satisfaction.
                    
                    During my time as a self-employed entrepreneur, I was responsible for the administration of all important business areas such as finance, purchasing, warehouse logistics, human resources, marketing and sales. The success of these activities was the sale of a business with 40% above the value of the acquisition and a 350% increase in sales volume within 4 years of another company. Employee turnover was always low.</p>
